<ul> <li>Alright I am tired of reading this one page, I just created a part 2 so I'm not exhausted reading one page.</li><li>Here I am going to start figuring out the formula for the first part</li><li>First part: Calculate probability of losing the martingale</li><li>To create asymettry, I am going to say that the chance I win is 40%. The chance I lose is 60%.</li><li>If I bet for one dollar, I will have a 40% chance of winning a dollar, thereby ending the bet. I call it Pw</li><li>If I have the same bet, and I win, 60% chance of losing, thereby making me double the bet next time, I call it Pl</li><li>Now, in this case I have three numbers: 40% and 1 dollar and 1 dollar. In this case, I am risking 1 dollar, to gain 1 dollar, I have a 40% chance to win.</li><li>This can be (Pw, Dr, Dg). Probability winning, dollars risked, and dollars gained.</li><li>If, however, I increase my risk to 2 dollars, I effectively increase my probability of winning.</li><li>THe probability of winning = 100% - the probability of losing </li><li>The probability of winning = 100% - (60%)^2</li><li>The probability of winning = 100% - 36%</li><li>Probability winning = 64%</li><li>Now my numbers are (64%, 2, 1)</li><li>If we do it again, we get (78%, 4, 1)</li><li>Let's make a formula. Let's call it Pw = 1 - (60%)^(log2(Dr)+1)</li><li>But where does the dollars gained go into this process? I have only assumed that the game "ends" when I gain one dollar. In order to win multiple dollars, I must repeat the process</li><li>Pw = (1 - (60%)^(log2(Dr)+1)^Dg</li><li>Going to make a python script with that equation </li><a href="martingale2.py">PythonScript </a><li>Let's plot this! But how do we choose to graph it? I don't currently know how to plot in 3D, so I will have the dollars_risked stay constant. Let's keep it at 128</li><img src="probability_winning.png"/><li>So now we have our graph. It looks like if we want an 80% chance of winning, we will win a little less than 20 dollars, which makes sense in terms of expected value. The percentage that you are certain is balanced out by how little you actually gain.</li><li>So this is the reality, but what is my expectation?? I know that I personally like to risk a little more if it can spell better amount, but when does it start decreasing??</li><li>In my mind I think of something like this:</li><img src="my_risk.png"/></ul>
