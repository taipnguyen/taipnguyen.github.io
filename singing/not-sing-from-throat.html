        <li> I was looking at a Youtube Short today. Apparently it is bad to "sing from your throat" and it's better to <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/fpEaG7hrYC8?si=L2ZZhfy7cIxQHRNm">sing from your mouth</a> </li>
        <li> So I looked at this <a href="https://www.musicgateway.com/blog/how-to/how-to-stop-singing-from-your-throat-in-5-steps">article </a> that explains to me how to sing more from my mouth</li>
        <li> I have to sing from my diaphgram? That doesn't make any sense. How does singing from my diaphragm help me sing better. Well, I do notice that my lips vibrate more when I sing from my diaphragm. Perhaps I should take larger breaths to bring awareness to my diaphragm</li>
        <li> I can also do a nice <b>yawn</b> before every note to really get that relaxed sense. Hmm, okay that helps</li>
        <li> Breathing a lot and good posture is good. Oof that will take a long time to get good at. </li>
        <li> Relax your throat?? Okay I have no idea how to do that besides repeating the last instructions </li>
        <li> And also, it's nice to drink a warm cup of tea to keep the throat healthy. Awww how sweet. </li>
        <li> Well, the impressions I got from this article was to be relaxed, and also to yawn a lot. Very interesting.. </li>
