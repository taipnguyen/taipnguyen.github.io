<ul>
    <li> I now have a lot more changes that I sometimes make to my file structures. I would feel more comfortable to have a development branch in case I mess up. Yes there is commit history, but I want to be sure just in case.</li>
    <li> I will make a new branch name and push to that one instead </li>
