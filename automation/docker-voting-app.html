        <li>I started up the docker containers. However, now I want to exit the containers, but they keep restarting. How to close them?</li>
        <li>I wanted to experiment and learn more about docker. I ended up downloading </li>
        <a href="https://github.com/dockersamples/example-voting-app">ExampleVoting</a>
        <li>and ended up running this command called "docker swarm". Apparently it has these resiliency measures where if you close down a docker container, it will keep restarting it.</li>
        <li>I ended up giving up on trying to close it down, because it kept just reopening every single time that I closed it. </li>
        <li>However, this link gave me a list of swarm commands </li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">DockerSwarm</a>
        <li>And it said if I do "docker swarm rm" Then it removes the service, and it will officially remove it, rather than just stopping docker container and having it boot up again.</li>
        <li>Good to know, if I docker swarm init, I have to docker swarm rm to stop the containers. This is a way to stop against unintended containers crashing </li>
