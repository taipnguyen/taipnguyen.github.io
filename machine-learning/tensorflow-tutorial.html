    <li> I'm watching <a href="https://youtu.be/tPYj3fFJGjk?si=7adAxLSJ3c0bCGYs">TensorFlow tutorial</a> on FreeCodeCamp and it's 6 hours long</li>
    <li> I realized that there are three types of learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning. </li>
    <li> Supervised is like a classifier. Given a machine knows that a good portion of children survived the titanic. What are the chances a random will survive the titanic?</li>
    <li> Unsupervised learning is like having data points and trying to find the "center of mass" at each of these points. I honestly don't know too much about this one besides the fact that the autoencoder uses this.</li>
    <li> Reinforcement learning is like what we think of when a machine plays tetris, snake, or chess. </li>
    <li> I currently know of two algorithms for supervised learning: Linear Regression and DNN Classifier</li>
    <li> Linear Regression just tried to make a best fit line given a bunch of points. You now have a line predicting the relationship between 2 (or more) variables based on a bunch of existing points</li>
    <li> DNN (Deep Neural Network) classifier is what I think of when I think of Neural Network. It takes a neural network with weights and biases. It changes based on some linear algebra and calculus stuff when there is a difference between its current guess and the training data</li>
    <li> I am learning one unsupervised learning algorithm called K-near classifier which takes the "center of mass" of some points</li>
