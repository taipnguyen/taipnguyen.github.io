    <li> Since I already have a decent grasp of the magic mirror solo, I wanted to start also playing the intro. It is supposed to be for the saxaphone, but it also sounds nice on trumpet </li>

    <li> I struggle with the speed of the notes. Unlike the last one where I struggled with the chops and higher notes </li>

    <li> I instead set the tempo to 50 beats per minute. The normal tempo is at 100 BPM. So I have a lot to go to tune it up </li>
