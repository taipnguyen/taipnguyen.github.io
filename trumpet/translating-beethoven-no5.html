    <li> I have an Eb part of beethoven no5 from imslp, but I want to transpose it to Bb. I'm going to use the "import PDF" option in musescore and see what happens</li>
    <li> Apparently it doesn't import everything correctly. I'm going to try to correct some of the inconsistencies and see how far I get. </li>
    <li> My trumpet buddy ended up translating the entire thing. Wow. The people around me work so hard..</li>
