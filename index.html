    Hello! You have reached my website where I document all the things that I 
    have learned since I have created the website (January 2024). The purpose
    of this website is to keep track of my personal interests, since I often 
    switch attention to different projects. This website is at least to keep an archive
    of my progress so that I at least can have a record of where I got.

        <th scope="col"><a href="./physics.html">Physics</a></th>

<h2> Thoughts </h2>
<ul>
    <li> I would like to improve this website in some way, maybe slowly incorporating 
        more flashy elements and animations. However, I feel that I need to learn the 
        fundamental skills of web development before I start doing that. For now, I will 
        only modify my website with vanilla html and css.
</ul>
