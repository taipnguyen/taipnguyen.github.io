This is my website to document all the things I've learned. I want to keep track of what I've learned. I'm going to start out this website really basic, but then eventually add 
some frameworks and css. Another thing I want to do for myself is not care too much about how this website looks, rather I want to just have a start point to develop my web development skills.
