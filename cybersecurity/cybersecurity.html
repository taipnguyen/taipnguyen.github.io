    <p>Ever since I was interested in computer science, I always wanted to know how to be an 31334 hacker. Of course, I feel the 
    introduction to hacking is a lot more difficult than regular web dev, and I also find that the people 
    on reddit who introduce me to cybersecurity are a lot more pretentious.

    Oh well, here I go.
