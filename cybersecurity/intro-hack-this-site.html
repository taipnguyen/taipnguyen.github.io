        <li>I have perpetually wanted to learn about cybersecurity from </li><a href="https://Hackthissite.org">Hackthissite</a>
        <li>but I've mostly used youtube tutorials to get me through the challenges.</li>
        <li>It's like going on youtube to do leetcode problems. It's not terrible, but I eventually want to release the training wheels</li>
        <li>So far I've learned that you can do a lot with the Console in Inspect Element </li>
        <li>Also, you can use server side scripting to inject code with anything you want. </li>
        <li>Some Apache websites allow you to have server side scripting for some reason, so this can be exploited.</li>
