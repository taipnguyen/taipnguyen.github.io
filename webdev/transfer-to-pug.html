        <li>Making these lists to list out my thought process is very annoying. I wonder if a framework can help me solve this problem. Time to install nodejs again</li>
        <li>Installing pug. Apparently you don't have to have an ending tag for lists. Now how to compile</li>
        <li>I did it. Now I can just write my lists in pug and it will compile to html </li>
        <li>I'm having trouble understanding how to organize my nav bars, but I will attempt another day (not always tomorrow). I also added an extra layer of work with the pug script</li>
