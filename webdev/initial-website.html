    <ul>
        <li> The first thing I had to do was set up a GoDaddy account and fork over 12 dollars to register a web domain. I've always wanted to do this so I didn't care I have to pay. 
        Although I don't like paying to learn something, I will make an exception for this because this is something I have always wanted to try so I find 
        it a worthwhile expense.
        </li>
        
        <li> Godaddy offers many options that you don't need: email, SEO help, Web Development help. I needed to uncheck all of those options. Very annoying
        </li>
        <li>I then made a Github repo called taipnguyen.github.io
        </li>
        <li>Making my Home page, I followed this <a href="https://learn.coderslang.com/0110-how-to-create-multiple-pages-in-html/">Nav table</a> I got introduced to the Nav tag and a tag. I remember a tag is used to insert links. I haven't seen the nav tag before though so it is 
        very interesting to see that the nav tag is used to surround a table of contents of sorts
        </li> 
        <li> I will stop now. But I am eventually going to make a separate blog for all of the things I like to do:
        1. Classical Physics
        2. Web Development
        3. Singing
        4. Trumpet
        5. AI and Reinforcement Learning 
        6. CI/CD and automation 
        7. Fitness and Health 
        </li>
        <li> The reason why I want to study multiple subjects is because I get distracted and bounce from topic to topic. My mentor listened to me and suggested
        I keep have a plethora of subjects that I want to commit to and cycle through them. This is because I get bored and can't commit to one thing.
        Before when I tried to create a project focusing on one idea, I would fail. I want to be able to create something while also switching from topic to topic. 
        </li>
        <li> Ugh, I tried to make a markdown list, but it apparently doesn't work in html. I'm going to change this file to markdown and just make the official one in html.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            I'm sure there is a better way to do this, but I will need to stop in order to preserve my curiosity.. I will also need to find a way to partition each blog into its own webpage. 
            This is a problem that has probably been solved years ago..but I will purposely take the longer route to appreciate the solution.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Okay apparently I can't just put the domain name in the github pages box and I have to do some dns record stuff. Ugh here we go drawing things out.
        </li>
        
        <li>
            I went to this website and finally figured out. <a href="https://jinnabalu.medium.com/godaddy-domain-with-github-pages-62aed906d4ef">Insert custom domain</a> I changed the CNAME variable to taipnguyen.githu.io and it worked 
        </li>
