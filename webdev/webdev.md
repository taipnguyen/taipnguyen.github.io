- The first thing I had to do was set up a GoDaddy account and fork over 12 dollars to register a web domain. I've always wanted to do this so I didn't care I have to pay. 
Although I don't like paying to learn something, I will make an exception for this because this is something I have always wanted to try so I find 
it a worthwhile expense.

- Godaddy offers many options that you don't need: email, SEO help, Web Development help. I needed to uncheck all of those options. Very annoying

3. Singing

5. AI and Reinforcement Learning 
6. CI/CD and automation 
7. Fitness and Health

I keep have a plethora of subjects that I want to commit to and cycle through them. This is because I get bored and can't commit to one thing.
Before when I tried to create a project focusing on one idea, I would fail. I want to be able to create something while also switching from topic to topic. 

- Ugh, I tried to make a markdown list, but it apparently doesn't work in html. I'm going to change this file to markdown and just make the official one in html.
I just want to write mang..
