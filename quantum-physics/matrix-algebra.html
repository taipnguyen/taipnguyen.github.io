        <li> I don't even know what the correct name for what I want to study, but I essentially want to learn more about matrices </li>
        <li> If you have a matrix that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix">unitary</a>, then its matrix inverse is equal to its conjugate transpose </li>
        <li> Why are these properties useful? Well you get a bunch of properties. One of them including an orthonormal (perpendicular) basis, which makes linear transformations really easy. </li>
        <li> If you have a matrix that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermitian_matrix">hermitian</a>, then its conjugate transpose is equal to itself</li>
        <li> Hermitian matrices can be diagonalized and eigendecomposed. </li>
