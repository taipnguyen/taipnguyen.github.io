<h1> None of this information is accurate. Please don't study quantum from this blog. This is my least accurate blog </h1>

<ul>
    <li> My roommate is hosting sessions on Sakurai's Quantum mechanics book. Although I don't plan on reading it. I will occassionally join his calls to see what he is talking about and hopefully gain some knowledge on his textbook problems </li>
    <li> Everything starts with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment">Stern-Gerlach experiment</a>. A particle shoots through a magnet and it either lands on one side or the other side of glass side. This proves the quantization of angular momentum in small particles   </li>
    <li> A ket is used to represent a quantum state. I often see ket spin up and spin down. These by themselves don't mean anything, but their meaning can be unlocked certain operators: position operators, momentum operators, and probability operators. Whatever that means..</li>
    <li> There's these things called eigenkets. If you have an obseravable (operator), and you get an eigenket out of it. That means that the eigenvalue can mean something. For the position operator, you get a meaningful position out of the eigenvalue. And the eigenket is "good" with that position operator. It's like a love relationship awwwww..</li>
    <li> Kets are like column vectors. So you also have bras that are row vectors. You multiply a bra by a ket, you get a number. Get it??? Bra-ket. Haha..</li>
    <li> Compatible observables (operators) happen when they can both act on the same ket and not destroy it like a lunatic. They still preserve it and keep it as an eigenket. If one can potentially destroy the other, they are incompatible observables. Like position and momentum. They are like Jinx and Vi. Jinx is the momentum. Vi is the position. Woww</li>
    <li> You can transform kets just like you can transform column vectors with matrices. These transformations can allow you to change the basis of your space. Just like how basis vectors change the vector space you work with (not really, please kick me if I'm innacurate). You can use a transformation operator to change the Hilbert space that you work with</li>
    <li> Diagonalization is a word. You want to make a matrix easy to work with? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix#How_to_diagonalize_a_matrix">Diagonalize </a>it into it's eigenkets and eigenvalues by taking det(A-lambda*I) </li>
    <li> Wave functions are a representation of a particle under a certain observable. If you "nail" down a particle to a certain position space, it will cave and give you its wave function. If you have a function that doesn't fundamentally change itself when acted upon by an operator (like sine) then you have an eigenfunction </li>
