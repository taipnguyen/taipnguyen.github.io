    <li> Everything starts with the 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment">
            Stern-Gerlach experiment
        </a>. 
        A silver atom shoots through a magnet and it either lands 
        on one side or the other side of glass pane. 
        This single experiment brings up the concept of quantum spin and is, 
        in my opinion, the single most important experiment that contributes
        to the weirdness of Quantum Mechanics. If this experiment didn't exist,
        Schrodinger's cat, quantum entanglement, and quantum computers wouldn't exist.
      </li>
    <li> A quantum state is represented by this thing called a ket.
        A lot of the times, kets can only either be an up ket or a down ket.
        Kets by themselves don't really have any physical meaning, 
        but their meaning can be understood by transforming it with these tools called operators: 
        position operators, momentum operators, and probability operators. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Operators are essentially transformers for functions like f(x) = sin(x). Operators
        can be really simple and turn a function into f(x) = 0 for example. 
        However, they can also be really complicated and turn a function into 
        f(x) = p^2 * sin(x) / 2m, just to give an example. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Oftentimes, because operators are so complicated when applied to functions, 
        physicists will forget the fact that functions are functions and just call them 
        vectors. A common example of this is calling f(x) = sin(x) [1, 0] and calling
        g(x) = cos(x) [0, 1]. This has the same meaning, because these two functions' 
        relationsips have the same relationships as these two vectors. They are both
        perpendicular to each other at all points. And now that we can reduce complicated
        functions to simple vectors, we can reduce the complicated operators into simple
        matrices. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes, not all the time, when you apply a transformation to something,
        you can get the same thing, but just stretched or shrunk. In linear algebra,
        this is called eigenvector. In quantum mechanics, this is called eigenkets.
    </li>
    <li> 
        Kets are often represented as column vectors, this is so that we
        can conveniently have row vectors that can be multiplie with these column vectors.
        These row vectors go by the name of bras. Interestingly enough, if you put these 
        words together, you get the name bra-ket. BRA-KET. Bracket... Clever, clever physicists..
    </li>
    <li> Compatible observables (operators) happen when they can both 
        act on the same ket and not destroy it like a lunatic. 
        They still preserve it and keep it as an eigenket. 
        If one can potentially destroy the other, they are incompatible 
        observables. Like position and momentum. They are like Jinx and Vi.
        Jinx is the momentum. Vi is the position. Woww</li>
    <li> You can transform kets just like you can transform column vectors with matrices. These transformations can allow you to change the basis of your space. Just like how basis vectors change the vector space you work with (not really, please kick me if I'm innacurate). You can use a transformation operator to change the Hilbert space that you work with</li>
    <li> Diagonalization is a word. You want to make a matrix easy to work with? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix#How_to_diagonalize_a_matrix">Diagonalize </a>it into it's eigenkets and eigenvalues by taking det(A-lambda*I) </li>
    <li> Wave functions are a representation of a particle under a certain observable. If you "nail" down a particle to a certain position space, it will cave and give you its wave function. If you have a function that doesn't fundamentally change itself when acted upon by an operator (like sine) then you have an eigenfunction </li>
