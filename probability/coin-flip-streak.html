    </ul> 
    <ul> 
        <li> I heard from somewhere that when you flip a coin a lot of times, it is very likely to get streaks of 6 or 7 heads in a row. 
            And people likely underestimate how often that happens, I wanted to run a simulation to see how true that was </li>
        <li> I built a <a href="/scripts/headtails.py">script</a> that generated this graph </li>
        <img src="../images/coin-streak.png" alt="Coin-streaks">
        <li> So there are some times when there are 6 streaks in 100 coin tosses. Since there are so many coin tosses, it is more likely. How much likely?> 
            Not sure, but all I can say is that I shouldn't 
            necessarily bank on an unlikely event not happening if I wait long enough.</li>
        <li> In fact, if I flip the coin infinitely times, I will probably see huge 
            streaks right? I just don't know how much I have to flip a coin for a "rare event"
             to happen. I mean a coin flipping heads 6 times is not that rare I guess</li>
